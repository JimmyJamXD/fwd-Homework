                <h1>Top</h1>
                <p class="main-grid-para">Top Lane is a very volatile lane on Summoner’s Rift and has been known for multiple seasons 
                        now as the ‘Counterpick Lane’ in Solo Queue. The reason for this is that a lot of Top Lane’s matchups 
                        are just flat out decided by who is forced to pick their Champion first. While this doesn’t mean there aren’t 
                        ways to win and affect the game through your Champion disadvantage, it does lead to this role being quite snowbally 
                        and catering to those that like to outplay their opponents and then snowball off their leads from them. 
                </p>

                <p></p>
    
                <h2>Slow Pushing</h2>
                <p class="main-grid-para">So, how do we create a Slow Push? To create a Slow Push, you simply need to kill the enemy caster minions 
                    when the lane is in a neutral state, or last hit when coming from under your turret. Both generate a minion 
                    advantage for you, and through last hitting, you maintain the advantage by relying solely on the minion’s 
                    damage to push the wave forward. Naturally, this is a slow process thus the name ‘slow push’. But, 
                    generally speaking, you need to have a 2 to 3 minion advantage over your enemy’s wave to generate a slow 
                    push if the wave is on your side of the lane. If it’s on the opponent’s, you’ll need a 4 to 5 advantage.

        <article class="main-grid-item">
            <div><img class="character-image" src="./img/evelyn.jpg" alt="Jungle character image"></div>
            <div class="main-grid-description">
                <h1>Jungle</h1>
                <p class="main-grid-para">Junglers, the most pressured role in the game, has a lot to be concerned about. Gank pathing, timing, 
                    which order they want to clear their camps, how they match against their opposing Jungler and what they 
                    can do to win the matchup... All of these things and more go through the minds of a Jungler at the early 
                    stages, but overall I believe the core thing that Junglers should focus on is playing towards their game’s 
                    win-condition.
                </p>
    
                <p class="main-grid-para">What does this even mean? Well, it’s a concept that concerns itself with the evolving state of the game. 
                    From level one, as most players do, evaluate yourself as the wincon. What actions you take as a Jungler 
                    early on are likely going to dictate the first 10-15 minutes of the game, so it’s important that you play 
                    to your Champion’s strengths and identity at that time.

        <article class="main-grid-item">
            <div class="main-grid-image"><img class="character-image" src="./img/zed.jpg" alt="Middle character image"></div>
            <div class="main-grid-description">
                <h1>Middle</h1>
                <h2>Manipulation/Farming</h2>
                <p class="main-grid-para">Mid Lane, next to Jungle, is one of the most difficult positions to play in the game. 
                    It requires not only all the capabilities of a laner, but also a Jungler as well. To that end, 
                    Mid Lane’s core concepts are twofold: Roaming & Farming.
                </p>
                <p class="main-grid-para">Like Top Lane, Mid does have wave manipulation tactics that can be employed. And again those are Fast 
                    Pushing, Slow Pushing, and Freezing. And, honestly, the context for both works pretty much the same. 
                    But, in the shortened lane of Mid and where there is more wave clear present with the Champion choices 
                    there, your windows to act off a fast push are smaller, slow pushes can be more easily disrupted, and freezes, 
                    while dangerous, aren’t as dangerous as they are in a longer lane.

        <article class="main-grid-item">
            <div><img class="character-image" src="./img/varus.jpg" alt="ADC character image"></div>
            <div class="main-grid-description">
                <h1>ADC</h1>
                <p class="main-grid-para">Whether you’re playing a Mage or rocking a more traditional Marksman, whoever you’re filling the 
                    Bot Laner position with is entirely focused on farming. The goal of a Bot Laner is to be a primary 
                    carry and damage outlet for the team, and to do that you need to hit item thresholds and stay at or ahead 
                    of the gold curve. Being a Long Sword or an Amp Tome down can make a huge difference whether you come out 
                    ahead of a fight or behind it, so Bot Laners are almost exclusively tunnel visioned on farm as they attempt
                    to reach powerful item spikes that increase their overall DPS.</p>

        <article class="main-grid-item">
            <div><img class="character-image" src="./img/nami.jpg" alt ="Support character image" ></div>
            <div>
                <h1>Support</h1>
                <p class="main-grid-para">Last, but not least, Supports. Warding is perhaps the biggest thing that every Support player focuses on. 
                    But there’s a difference between applying vision and applying effective vision. Many support players will 
                    simply run to common ward locations and drop off their totems and sight wards thinking that because they 
                    held common angles that they’re doing their jobs. But warding is an adaptive concept, much like fighting,
                    wave manipulation, and gameplanning is for other roles.
